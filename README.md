##Bluetooth Lights

This is an Arduino sketch that is meant to be used with my SpeechBlinker iOS app. It is modified from the Simple Controls sketch provided by RedBearLab in their nRF8001 library. 

####Hardware Needed

- Arduino
- 3x 220 ohm resistors
- Common-cathode RGB LED (or 3 individual LEDs wired to the same ground pin)
